# Interactive AWS CloudFormation Docs
A simple JavaScript that can be ran on AWS CloudFormation Documentation to make it more interactive.

The hope is that this is a building block to make an interactive template builder based on the docs.

## To try it out

1. Visit this typical CloudFormation Documentation URL:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ecs-service.html

2) Open the Developers Tool JavaScript console.

3) Paste the contents of the [test_script_to_paste_into_console.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseRolles/interactive-aws-cloudformation-docs/master/test_script_to_paste_into_console.js) file from this repository.

4) Hover over the YAML version of the "Syntax" section.
